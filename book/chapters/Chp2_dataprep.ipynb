    "\n",
    "Previous work to convert MODIS NDSI snow cover maps have used finer-scale resolution satellites, like Landsat, to identify at what threshold the NDSI value represents \"snow\" or \"no snow.\" Here we use a network of camera traps as the fine-scale ground data. While they are limited in spatial scale to their field of view (20-30m), they can be set up in networks of up to 1000s of cameras, which, when done in large regions, approaches the coverage of satellite maps. Their ability to cover large regions and observe environmental information makes them a advantegous ground-based data source to compare to satellite information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The camera trap network that we will use is part of the Scandcam network (website: viltkamera.nina.no). Scandcam is a long-term, year-round study established in 2010 by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research to monitor recovering Eurasian lynx (*Lynx lynx*). Optimized for lynx detection, the cameras are placed in mostly forested habitats and areas that lynx use (e.g., wildlife trails, forest roads, and along the base of cliffs/boulders) (Angoh et al. 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a map of locations of Scandcam cameras (yellow points: n = 1181) in Norway and Sweden. Camera data for this tutorial is from three winters (January - March 2018, October 2018 - April 2019, October 2019 - April 2020). MODIS NDSI Snow Cover base map is from the same corresponding winters. It is a composite snow cover map created from mean MODIS NDSI snow cover values from the study period. The cameras spread a 10 degree latitudinal gradient (59 - 69 degrees North, and 8-16 degrees East), with no more than one camera per 2km<sup>2</sup> area across a 350,000 km<sup>2</sup> area. Seeing both the MODIS NDSI and camera trap locations together shows the large coverage of the cameras, and subsequently their ability to indicate snow presence versus absence in a variety of conditions.
